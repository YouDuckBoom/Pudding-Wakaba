[h1] Stackable Holy Mantle [/h1]
Have multiple shields at the same time! Collecting multiple Holy Mantle items now allows to give corresponding amount of shields.
This mod also gives multiple shields for Blanket item if you entered a Boss Room, Plus now works on Dogma and The Beast fight!
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2613009134]Stackable Holy Mantle is also available as a seperate mod.[/url]

[h1] Curse of Flames (Experimental) [/h1]
 - Isaac cannot touch items! the items are cursed and it will be on fire!
 - Trying to get items will turn item to Wisps.
 - Wisps spawned this way are much stronger than regular wisps.
 - Plot-Critical items like Polaroid/Negative can be collected as normal even when curse is active.

[h1] Inventory Descriptions (Experimental) [/h1]
 - Press F5 to show current items you have. Pressing F5 again to exit list mode.
 - Also shows current curse descriptions.
